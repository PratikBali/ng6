              <strong>1. Create basic angular application without editing anything and try
                to understand project structure.</strong><br>
              Create simple angular project using below command as ng new FirstApp
              It will create one folder named as FirstApp Open that project in Visual Studio Code Invoke command to start server as
              ng serve
              Now try to run our application using chrome browser as
              http://localhost:4200
              After execution it will display default angular application.
              Now find out the meaning of files used in this project that we discussed in previous sessions.

            <strong>2. Create Angular application which will display “Marvellous Infosystems"
              as header.</strong><br>
            Follow all the above steps to create new project and update index.html file
            to display desired string.

          <p>
            <strong>3. Create Angular application which will Display “Marvellous Infosystems” by updating
            app component.</strong><br>
            App component is our root component and change the existing name
            characteristics of app.component.ts file and change it to the “Marvellous Infosystems”
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>4. Create Angular application which will Display Header as “Marvellous Infosystems”
            and subheader as “Educating for better tomorrow”.</strong><br>
            For this you have to update app.component.html file and headers as h1 and h2.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>5. Rewrite above application and use inline html contents.</strong><br>
              For that purpose we have to update the decorator (@Component) in app.component.ts file.
              Remove templateUrl and add template.
              After that add our contents from html file after that template name in (` `).
